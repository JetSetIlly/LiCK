This directory  contains  earlier  implementations  of  the  BWT.
Although  impractical  they served the purpose during development
-- to help me understand how this thing works. It  may  therefore
be useful for others to examine these files as they don't contain
any of  the  code  required  for  an  efficient  BWT  that  would
otherwise distract.

The file named "1.bwt_lib.c"  is  grossly  inefficient  and  even
moderately sized files would require obscene amounts of memory.

"2.bwt_lib.c" attempts to solve the memory problem by introducing
an  array  of  pointers that indicate the start of each imaginary
row in the rotation matrix. However, it is still too  slow.  This
is due entirely to the memory compare function.



"4.bwt_lib.c" is a playground for different  sort  routines.  The
Radix  sort is particularly promising but it is broken for binary
input -- probably an off-by-one error for characters with a value
of 0.
